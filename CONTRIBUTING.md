## ✅ Best Practices

- **Clear commits**: one commit = one idea, with a descriptive message following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention.
- **Tests**: make sure all tests pass, and add new ones when necessary.
- **Code style**: follow the project’s coding conventions (see linter/config files if available).
- **Pull Requests**:

  - Describe the issue fixed or the feature added.
  - Link to the related issue, if any.
  - Prefer several small PRs over one very large one.
